# Project-Wave
Project Wave is a AI-Wave game where the player kills AI to survive and also gain xp so that they can level up certain attributes. Currently, Project Wave is a prototype of what the full game could be, and may receive future updates/be released in the future as a full game.

If you want to test out the game, make sure you accomplish the following:
1. Download Unreal Engine 5 through the Epic Games launcher.
2. Download this game.
3. Right click on Project_20002219.uproject and select "Generate Visual Studio project files".
4. Open the Project_20002219.uproject file. This will come up with a notification to build, which you must do.
5. Done! The game should launch in Unreal Engine 5's editor.
